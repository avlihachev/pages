Most early-stage founders look at their bank account to judge business health. But what if your startup is showing profit and you're still running out of cash?

Let’s break down why **profit ≠ cash**:

- **Profit** = Revenue - Expenses (accrual based)
- **Cash flow** = Actual money in/out

> A startup can be profitable on paper but run out of money due to delayed payments, inventory, or investments.

Here’s what to track instead:

- Cash runway
- Burn rate
- Receivables and payables
