Most startup founders spend way too much time manually updating spreadsheets. Here are 5 Excel formulas that will automate your financial tracking and save you hours every week.

## 1. SUMIFS - Conditional Revenue Tracking

**What it does:** Calculates revenue based on multiple criteria (date range, product type, customer segment)

```excel
=SUMIFS(Revenue_Column, Date_Column, ">=1/1/2025", Date_Column, "<=1/31/2025", Product_Column, "SaaS")
```

**Use case:** Track monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by product line or customer segment.

## 2. NETWORKDAYS - Burn Rate Calculation

**What it does:** Calculates business days between dates for accurate burn rate

```excel
=Total_Expenses/NETWORKDAYS(Start_Date, End_Date)
```

**Use case:** Calculate daily burn rate excluding weekends and holidays.

## 3. FORECAST - Revenue Projections

**What it does:** Predicts future revenue based on historical data

```excel
=FORECAST(Future_Month, Known_Revenue_Range, Known_Month_Range)
```

**Use case:** Create 12-month revenue projections for investor presentations.

## 4. VLOOKUP - Customer Data Matching

**What it does:** Automatically pulls customer information from master database

```excel
=VLOOKUP(Customer_ID, Customer_Database, Column_Number, FALSE)
```

**Use case:** Auto-populate invoices with customer details and pricing tiers.

## 5. IF with AND/OR - Automated Alerts

**What it does:** Creates conditional alerts for key metrics

```excel
=IF(AND(Cash_Balance<30000, Burn_Rate>5000), "ALERT: Low runway", "OK")
```

**Use case:** Get automatic warnings when cash runway drops below 6 months.

## Pro Tips for Implementation

### 1. Create Named Ranges

Instead of cell references like A1:A100, use names like "Monthly_Revenue" for easier formula management.

### 2. Use Data Validation

Set up dropdown lists for categories to ensure consistent data entry.

### 3. Build Templates

Create reusable templates with these formulas already set up.
