Here are 5 Excel formulas that will automate your financial tracking and save you hours every week.\n1. SUMIFS - Conditional Revenue Tracking What it does: Calculates revenue based on multiple criteria (date range, product type, customer segment)\n=SUMIFS(Revenue_Column, Date_Column, \u0026#34;\u0026gt;=1/1/2025\u0026#34;, Date_Column, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;=1/31/2025\u0026#34;, Product_Column, \u0026#34;SaaS\u0026#34;) Use case: Track monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by product line or customer segment.\n2. NETWORKDAYS - Burn Rate Calculation What it does: Calculates business days between dates for accurate burn rate\n=Total_Expenses/NETWORKDAYS(Start_Date, End_Date) Use case: Calculate daily burn rate excluding weekends and holidays.\n3. FORECAST - Revenue Projections What it does: Predicts future revenue based on historical data\n=FORECAST(Future_Month, Known_Revenue_Range, Known_Month_Range) Use case: Create 12-month revenue projections for investor presentations.\n4. VLOOKUP - Customer Data Matching What it does: Automatically pulls customer information from master database\n=VLOOKUP(Customer_ID, Customer_Database, Column_Number, FALSE) Use case: Auto-populate invoices with customer details and pricing tiers.\n5. IF with AND/OR - Automated Alerts What it does: Creates conditional alerts for key metrics\n=IF(AND(Cash_Balance\u0026lt;30000, Burn_Rate\u0026gt;5000), \u0026#34;ALERT: Low runway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;) Use case: Get automatic warnings when cash runway drops below 6 months.\nPro Tips for Implementation 1. Create Named Ranges Instead of cell references like A1:A100, use names like \u0026ldquo;Monthly_Revenue\u0026rdquo; for easier formula management.\n2. Use Data Validation Set up dropdown lists for categories to ensure consistent data entry.\n3.

Automation Before Hiring Don\u0026rsquo;t hire someone to do manual work - automate it first, then hire for strategic work.\n2. Start with Pain Points Focus on the most time-consuming manual tasks first for biggest impact.\n3. Real-Time Beats Perfect Real-time approximate data is better than perfect data that\u0026rsquo;s weeks old.\n4. Think Integration, Not Tools Connected systems beat best-in-class individual tools.\nWhat This Means for Your SaaS You might benefit from similar automation if:\nYou\u0026rsquo;re spending 10+ hours weekly on financial admin Your financial reports are always behind schedule You\u0026rsquo;re making decisions based on outdated data You\u0026rsquo;re considering hiring a full-time finance person Implementation Options DIY Approach: Start with tools like Zapier to connect your existing systems.\nCustom Solution: For complex needs like TechStart\u0026rsquo;s, custom development provides the best ROI.\nHybrid Approach: Use existing tools where possible, custom code for unique requirements.\nWant Similar Results?
